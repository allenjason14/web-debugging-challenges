Index.html:
I added an equal sign on the html script to finish g-app="miniRouting"
I closed the opening brackets for the script that referred to angular-ui.

app.js:
Each state had an opening and a closing parethnesis rather than .state("name", . . . In other words, I closed the parenthesis in the correct location at the end of each state.
The last state was outside of the angular.module, so I moved the closing parenthesis so it would surround each state properly.
